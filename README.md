# NER-in-legal-text-BERT

Here I investigate a dataset containing German federal court decisions annotated with 19 different labels (source: https://github.com/elenanereiss/Legal-Entity-Recognition) and fine-tune 'bert-base-german-cased' from huggingface to recognize these labels.

Requirements to run the notebook are in the requirements.txt file
